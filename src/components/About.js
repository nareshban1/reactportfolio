                    I have been interested in web designing for a long time. I just
                    completed BSc CSIT (Hons) degree from Herald College, University of
                    Wolverhampton. I am really curious about a lot of technologies and
                    always try to learn and experience as much as I can. I am interested 
                    in front end development and am also starting to learn making illustrations and UI designs. 
                    I ocassionally enjoy gaming with my friends.
